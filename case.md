## Scenario

When i open the page it needs to show listing page which includes all tournaments at the beginning. In this case "tournaments query" must be handled in server side rendering. If i refresh the page all the items votes which coming from database needs to be resetted.

### Menu & Header

- [x] Header must include Community Gaming's logo on left side and menu on right side.
- [x] Menu must includes "Tournaments Listing", "Add New", "Sign In" items. (Sign-in will be non-functional it's gonna be just showing)

### State

- [ ] You need to send a request to get 6 tournaments tournaments from database for saving them to localStorage as an initial state. When that request happened after rendering there must be a "loading" information in interface. if there are anyother tournaments which already added before by user; these needs to be also exist in localStorage in same initial state. All tournaments votes must be zero if they are coming from database directly. When i soft refresh the page; it needs to be take values from "apollo cache". otherwise it can send request again.

### Tournament Cards

- [ ] Cars will have point amount, cover image, tournament name, owner name, deadline and last vote date which is a meaningful time format.
- [ ] Every tournament card will have 4 buttons:
  - [ ] **Up vote**: When user clicks on it tournaments point must be increased 1 point.
  - [ ] **Down vote**: When user clicks on it tournaments point must be decreased 1 point.
  - [ ] **Delete**: This button will be shown when card is hovered. When user clicks on it there must be a confirmation modal shown which it's title must include clicked item's tournament name which is saying "are you sure about to delete this tournament". This modal will have "**Cancel**" and "**Delete**" buttons.
  - [ ] **Update**: When user clicks on it there must be a modal shown which includes clicked item's informations to edit it. This modal will have "**Cancel**" and "**Save**" buttons.
- [ ] Every action without voting must give a feedback to users with like toast messages or alerts. Like "Tournament deleted successfully".

### Sorting Cards

- [ ] Tournament's must be sorted from of dropdown button or select box which includes "**order by most voted**" and "**order by less voted**" options.
- [ ] Default sorting of cards must be vote count by "**most voted**" points.
- [ ] If there are any cards got same points; sorting needs to be done via "**Last Voting Date**". The newest voted must be shown in first order.

### Pagination

- [ ] There must be a pagionation which includes 6 items per page.

### Adding a tournament

- [ ] I can be able to add a new tournament via clicking "**Add New Tournament**" button which redirect user a page which must include "coverImage, name, alias, owner id _(this field must be disabled)_, owner username, owner avatar, deadline ( you can use a datepicker for it or users can directly type date in it ), prize" form fields in it. All the fiels which written are mandotary except owner id information. It needs to be random UUID. There must be a validation before save the tournament. This tournament needs to be saved on "localStorage". After adding a tournament it needs to redirect me to listing page. After adding a tournament, you need to refetch the "query" which you already send in server side.
